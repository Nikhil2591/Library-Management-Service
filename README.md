# Library-Management-Service

In this project I am currently building a library management system using ASP.NET core framework with MVC. I gained skills in Model View Controller design pattern, Database migrations, dependency injection, implementing services and the ASP.NET Core Entity Framework. This project involves building a back-end database using SQL Server 2016 express and SQL Server Management Studio. The Web application is being developed in Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition using the C# programming language.

This project was inspired by Wes Doyle ASP.NET Core Web App Tutorial -Five Part Series on youtube in which I followed to develop this application.
